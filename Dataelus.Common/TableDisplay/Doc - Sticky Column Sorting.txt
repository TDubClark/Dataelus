Rules for sorting sticky objects
9/25/2014

If one of the objects is sticky, and the other is not, then the sticky takes precedence


First round, is to respect absolute position stickiness

Then after that is all sorted, we go through and merge in where the other columns belong, according to those columns which are sticky to other columns.

Process:
1) Remove all items which are sticky to a column
2) Add those items back in right after the appropriate column



Additional Rules for handling merges
1) Start with a base list, into which order is merged.
	- This starts with each column being stuck to the column preceding it
	- Second, if a column is assigned a specific order, then it becomes "unstuck"
	- When ordering, stickiness takes precedence
